# Component Usage Guide

This guide provides best practices for working with components in our application.

## Component Categories

Components are organized into the following categories:

- **Layout:** Components that structure the application layout
- **UI:** Reusable UI elements like buttons, cards, etc.
- **Page:** Page-level components that represent routes
- **Feature:** Components tied to specific application features
- **Auth:** Authentication-related components
- **Form:** Form components and controls
- **Util:** Utility components for common functionality

## Adding New Components

When adding a new component:

1. Check if a similar component already exists in the registry
2. Follow the established naming conventions
3. Add proper JSDoc documentation
4. Update the component registry
5. Use the appropriate folder structure based on the component type

## Component Dependencies

Keep component dependencies minimal to improve reusability. If a component requires many dependencies, consider breaking it down into smaller components.

## Component Examples

Here are examples of well-structured components in our application:

### Layout

Path: `components/Layout/Layout.tsx`

Purpose: Main layout wrapper that includes Header, Sidebar, and Footer

### Header

Path: `components/Layout/Header.tsx`

Purpose: Application header with navigation and user menu

### ProtectedRoute

Path: `components/Auth/ProtectedRoute.tsx`

Purpose: Route wrapper that checks for authentication
